# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I built an app where you can select to receive one of two message options, either an affirmation or a mantra. One of the features is that once a message is given, you can clear it from your display. The problem the app is solving is having to create your own affirmation or mantra. This application provides the desired content for you.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
First create a directory on your local machine where you want to store the app.
Next copy and paste this link into the browser: https://github.com/awirth224/self-care-center
Once the link is pulled up, click the green 'code' button and copy the SSH field.
In your terminal type 'git clone' and paste the SSH field you copied from the link inside the directory you created.
Next type 'open index.html' and the app will open in your browser!


### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I had four days to work on the project and spent about 12-14 hours working on it. I am in week 3 of the Turing program.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals of this project were to gain competence in making a page look identical to a comp given using HTML and CSS, creating basic functionality using javascript and an additional functionality of our choosing using javascript.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
One of the biggest challenges I faced in this project was figuring out how to properly check which radio button was selected and then use that to match which array needed to be accessed for the display. To overcome this challenge I researched on my own via MDN W3Schools and my HTML/CSS text book all about radio buttons and the checked property to first ensure that my syntax was correct. Then I reached out to mod2 students to rubber duck my ideas with and they were helpful in guiding me through holes in my logic.

A win I had in this project was definitely gaining comfortability using flexbox. It can be tricky and cause doubt surrounding creating another div, but after playing around with it in this project I feel good. 
Another win was how quickly I was able to figure out the clear button feature. It made me feel good about the concepts I have retained this inning, especially adding and removing classes. I had time to dabble with adding the opacity effect on the button which was super cool and fun. This win certainly made me want to do more features and I did start but didn't finish all the bullet points in time so I removed them for clean reading.
