# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I built an app where you can select to receive one of two message options, either an affirmation or a mantra. One of the features is that once a message is given, you can clear it from your display. The problem the app is solving is having to create your own affirmation or mantra. This application provides the desired content for you.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

Once the link is pulled up, click the green 'code' button and copy the SSH field.
In your terminal type 'git clone' and paste the SSH field you copied from the link inside the directory you created.
Next type 'open index.html' and the app will open in your browser!
